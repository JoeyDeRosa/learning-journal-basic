      <h2>12/19/16 Joey DeRosa Learning Journal Day11</h2>
      <p>Today was The day we pitched our project ideas, A lot of good ones there but I think it is obvious that TrollPy is the way to go. The data structure today was called Deque and was basiclly a renamed doubly linked list. Really glad that pyramid was introduced and I no longer have to trouble shoot errors that seem to just create themselves in code that was previousley working.</p>
